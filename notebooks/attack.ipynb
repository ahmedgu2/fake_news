    "#     The Tribeca Film Festival Announces Winners - The New York Times,Mekado Murphy,\"The Tribeca Film Festival announced its winners Thursday, with movies from   feature directors and seasoned veterans taking prizes. The Founders Award for best narrative feature went to the comedy “Dean,” the directorial debut of Demetri Martin, who also wrote and stars in the movie. The best international feature prize went to “Junction 48,” an Israeli film with a Palestinian rapper at its center. Craig Atkinson’s “Do Not Resist,” about the militarization of police forces in the United States, won the prize for best documentary feature. All three awards come with $20, 000 prizes. Priscilla Anany won the prize for best new narrative director for her Ghanaian film “Children of the Mountain,” about a woman who faces scrutiny when her child is born with birth defects. The Albert Maysles New Documentary Director Prize went to David Feige for “Untouchable,” which looks at the effect of strict sex offender laws in the United States. The Nora Ephron Prize, awarded to a female director or screenwriter, was given to Rachel Tunnard for her dark comedy “Adult Life Skills,” about a young woman who moves back to her hometown and into a shed in her mother’s backyard. The festival continues through April 24, with additional screenings of some of the prizewinning films to be held this weekend. The festival’s audience awards will be announced April 23.\n",
